PRE_LAUNCH.txt

mongo collection books_offline_history is storing the book_id attribute as a String.  This is inconsistent with how Bookmarks store book_id as ObjectId.  Since there are only 8 of these docs, we can hand mnigrate to an ObjectId pre-launch.

index mongo with mongoid rake task
index solr

DNS stuff - lin1 to vr1

remove basic auth from Rails

nginx.conf
	change passenger_pre_start http://vr1.mihudie.com/; 
	to passenger_pre_start http://mihudie.com/; 

nginx sites-available mihudie.com
	change server_name vr1.mihudie.com;
	to server_name mihudie.com www.mihudie.com;

ensure www.mihudie.com redirects to mihudie.com

ensure nginx request without domain is default server and returns nothing
