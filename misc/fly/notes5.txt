change them-list -> theme-list

Theme behviors work well. Nice ;)  Need a method to select theme in the account page.  It will be on a page account/set-theme

I added a little padding to the bottom of the screen under the two buttons (theme and scroll to top) by creating an empty <p>.  Need to do this as the iPhone wil pull up its nav menu if you touh too close to the bottom.

Scroll to top buttom changes its background and font on click.  But on mobile, the style changes to do go back after the behavior is complete. 	      	     	 

change class names:
theme-1 -> theme-lite-small
theme-2 -> theme-dark-small
theme-3 -> theme-lite-medium
theme-4 -> theme-dark-medium
theme-5 -> theme-lite-large
theme-6 -> theme-dark-large

I need a plan for how the user's theme selection will be stored.  If you can set a cookie named mhd_theme with a value of the theme class name, that might be easiest.
