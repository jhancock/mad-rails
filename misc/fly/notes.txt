header
  area with logo, login and search should be in menu bar.  No need for two lines
	
  search button.  when width is narrow on desktop, there needs to be a margin on the right of the button.

  don't want categories in main area.  Would like to see sidebar similar to old site.

btn styles should be button.
btn btn-warning
  lets find another name beside warning for a secondary option.  We do want a warning button though!
button use for next and previous chapters need work

need pagination styling
should put pagination at top and bottom for mobile so user doesdn't have to scroll too much.
maybe pagination on mobile should hide numbered pages and only show prev, next, first, last?

need theme menu item.  should display similar to catgories.

three font sizes.  small medium large.  6 themes.  Other fonts in the system should change depending on user's choice of small medium large.

need footer

book list used to have meta-data of title, data-summary, data-tags, data-chars.  Which of these is good for SEO?

detail-span needs area for tags and #chars

main div should be called main with role main

boo-show => book-show
  this style does not seem to be in the css.  What is it doing?
