cookie mhd_theme needs a long expire date.

iPad - if I click outside the tooltip, it does not close.  It only closes if I click inside or on another link

iPad - tooltip in third column needs to open in opposite direction.

iPad - header items on left disapear after I toggle on/off a book detail.

iPad has white margins when in dark reading mode.

Span for author on book list.  On mobile author shows up on right.  On dekstop/tablet, author does not show at all.  Need a solution for this.

detail-span-action needs less top padding.

nav menu does not toggle off on mobile.

need pagination style for desktop.  js buttons for mobile.

logout link in menu bar if not mobile.  only on account page for mobile

%h2 on lists page, such as: popular books - page 1 - sort by recent
  can not tell where the link is.  Its all blue.

div class error.  red bar is too thin.  lets try for double the current.

font size default is large.  I think medium would be best.

book-show -> ?? 

%div{:class => "content clearfix"}
  %div{:class => "main", :role => "main"}
Is this needed?  can I have just:
%div{:class => "content clearfix", :role => "main"}

%div{:class => "search-list"}
  %ul{:class => "book-list book-list-block"}
Its not always going to be books in search results

detail div popup is too easily triggered.  We want the hover closer to the text boundary.

%div{:class => "detail-span-action"}
  buttons need to be right aligned.  this shows when you have only one button

in reading mode with large dark theme it is obvious there is more margin on the right.

desktop view has only one color...a touch of orange and that's all.

lower the bottom line of the text in header...just a touch.  including search field.

form fields font needs to be bigger.

do we need rollover effect on buttons?
