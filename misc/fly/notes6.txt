for side-bar and one-third, one-half divs that we talked about...don't do anything for this next set of changes.  Lets wait for me to get more finished and then we can decide.

cookie mhd_theme needs a smarter expire date.  set it everytime user reads a page.

iPad - if I click outside the tooltip, it does not close.  It only closes if I click inside or on another link

iPad - detail-span in third column needs to open in opposite direction.

iPad - header items on left disapear after I toggle on/off a book detail.

white margins (don't want) when in dark reading mode (desktop and iPad)

Span for author on book list.  On mobile author shows up on right.  On dekstop/tablet, author does not show at all.  Put author next to title when diplayed.

detail-span-action needs less top padding.

nav menu does not toggle off on mobile/iPad.

need pagination style for desktop.  js buttons for mobile.  http://mislav.uniqpath.com/will_paginate/

add styles for prev and next on js side menu (pagination)

logout link in menu bar if not mobile. hidden if mobile.

%h2 on lists page, such as: popular books - page 1 - sort by recent
  can not tell where the link is.  Its all blue.  Also, want to call this h1, not h2

div class error.  red bar is too thin.  lets try for double the current.

read font size default is large.  I think medium would be best.

book-show -> list-container

%div{:class => "content clearfix"}
  %div{:class => "main", :role => "main"}
Is this needed?  can I have just:
%div{:class => "content clearfix", :role => "main"}

%div{:class => "search-list"}
  %ul{:class => "book-list book-list-block"}
Its not always going to be books in search results
maybe try:
%div{:class => "search-list"}
  %ul{:class => "search-list-item search-list-block"}

detail-span popup is too easily triggered.  We want the hover closer to the text boundary.

%div{:class => "detail-span-action"}
  buttons need to be right aligned.  this shows when you have only one button

in reading mode on mobile with large dark theme it is obvious there is more margin on the right.

lower the bottom line of the text in header...just a touch.  including search field.  The hieght of the menu bar is good.  Do not make it smaller.

form fields font needs to be bigger.  At least on desktop, this needs to change.
