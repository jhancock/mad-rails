book-show -> ?? 

%ul{:class => "list-column details", "data-action" => "click"}
  data-action can be renamed toggle or activate

%div{:class => "content clearfix"}
  %div{:class => "main", :role => "main"}
Is this needed?  can I have just:
%div{:class => "content clearfix", :role => "main"}

%div{:class => "search-list"}
  %ul{:class => "book-list book-list-block"}
Its not always going to be books in search results

detail div popup is too easily triggered.  We want the hover closer to the text boundary.

desktop view has only one color...a touch of orange and that's all.

lower the bottom line of the text in header...just a touch.  including search field.

need pagination style for desktop.  js buttons for mobile.

form fields font needs to be bigger.

do we need rollover effect on buttons?
