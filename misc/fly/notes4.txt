Names and behavior for book-show index-list, last-review index-list, etc.
There are two behaviors: 
1 - The li's are flowing or in a grid.  In "last-review index-list", it is flowing.  in "book-show index-list" there are 3 or 1 columns.
2 - Detail-span's have behavior: hover, click, etc.  This should be part of the containing div's class names.  I will want to reuse this pattern when showing lists of Authors, Users, Rating, etc. 

For example. the last-review list could be in  <div class="list-flow details">
The book-show list would be in <div class="list-column details">.  If I don't need the detail-span behavior I leave off the "details" class: <div class="list-flow"> or <div class="list-column">.

Do we need <div class="book-list"> nested.  Isn't one div containing the list enough?

change ipt-text -> input-text

logout link in header shows up on mobile

on desktop, nav lists (categories list) should open/close on hover.

on mobile, the previous page button (on page-bar) when reading a book is missing (when on page greater than 1).  On desktop it shows.

font in form fields is too small.

font in error and notice divs is too small.

I'm using div's for error notices in forms.  Try a login error to see.  I don't think I need the <p> classes for notice and error.  The div classes are enough.

error and notice font should be black..not red or blue. For an error div, lets try adding a solid red vertical bar in the left margin.

footer should be centered
