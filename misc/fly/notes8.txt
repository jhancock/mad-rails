if notice or error div is in form-model and not in form, links are styled different.  They should be the same.  See /register, type in an existing registered email with two matching passwords and you can see an error message with a link that is different from the link for the notice message inside the form div.  I need to put the error divs in form-model, not in the form div.

mobile - if I have two buttons in detail-span-action, they do not fit next to each other.  Go to the bookmarks page on production server and you can see this problem:  I have a read button and a delete-bookmark button.

style.css.map being referenced in production

jquery-1.11.1.min.js is not being cached for production server.  weird.  it works as expected in dev.  only seems to be happening on firefox.  Probably not a problem with your code.  Could be related to style.css.map being referenced...don't know.
