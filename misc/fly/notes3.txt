===========
menus for 'nav l'
------------------
menu-left>>menu-item>>menu-content>>

for example:
ul#nav,l>>li#nav-menu>>ul#nav-flow
ul#nav,l>>li#nav-menu>>ul#nav-line
  an li can have a class "notice" to be highlighted with an orange "*"
    if one line has this mark, the parent anchor text has this mark.

menu content area should be light background and dark text.

-------------------

form-model needs a max-width.  two choices.  default is normal (less than today).  add class "wide" for wider form.

button font on mobile needs to be stronger/larger.  hard to read the white on blue.
form-action div should have margin on right so button is not too far to right.
form-model should not be so wide.  Do not need long entry fields.  Need bigger entry fields and buttons.

form field height and text is too small on desktop.  ok on mobile.

admin pages need layout with permanent left sidebar for nav.  This will make the whole width wider.  The main content div stays the same width.
  admin page "main content" might need to be able to have two columns in it.

flash message two styles: notice and error
  light background.  dark text.  thin darker border.
  need class "flash-removable".  removable means if the user taps somewhere in the right, it closes.
  also need class "flash" for if it is not removable.

all class names should use - not _

<ul class="header-side">
should be called header-right

header-warp => header-wrap

detail-span not working on desktop
 mobile will click-through  on first click.
buttons in detail-span have wrong text color.  hard to read.

pure-checkbox  Is this being used?

get rid of bg-primary, etc.

change to type button - login button still not right

mobile search icon needs bottom padding.

on desktop, search field and login/register/logout links  need more top margin.

on mobile, the previous page button (on page-bar) when reading a book is missing (when on page greater than 1).  On desktop it shows.
