Mandrill webhooks
------------------
mandrill webhook for register@app.mihudie.com
https://github.com/evendis/mandrill-rails

set Mandrill webhook for bounced email.  Capture bounce info in user and log UserEvent. Don't send more emails to that address until they use a verified address.  Display account notice if email_bounced_at is set.

attribute email bounces to password_reset_request, register, change_email...all of them in one bucket.  a bounce is a bounce.

set User.email_bounced_at if mandrill says it bounced.
    when an email is verified, unset email_bounced_at
    if an email is not verified and email_bounced_at is greater then email_verified_at, don't send the email and log to UserEvents

ANDREA translations for change_password_post, reset_password_post, etc

ANDREA email_verify_notice.html.haml translate item 4

ANDREA in config/locales/en.yml, change kaminari tranlsations.  tag list views and bookmarks...pagination shows "Displaying all 26 books" for lists without more than 50 items.  Possibly shows something different for when user has only one item.  need to dig into kanamari for this.

DONE (lazy handling at run-time) books 230 dups, 228 have same origin
    keep most recent (based on updated_at).  mark duplicate with duplicate attribute that has id of the kept version.  
    add read_count of dup to kept book
    update bookmarks to point to master book

DONE book#read needs to know that there could be more than one book with the same title/author pair.  If there is, there should be only one that does not have :duplicate attribute (need to add duplicate management to admin).  BUT needs to gracefully handle the case if there is more than one.

sitemap.xml script
  sitemap should not include old book links with objectId??
  Canonical url should be the one with author/title.
  should these links contain microdata?

setup exception_notificaion and test. 
  see if we can write exceptions to file and have scout pick them up.

error: http://dev.mihudie.com/books/%E8%89%BE%E5%B0%8F%E5%9B%BE/%E5%88%98%E8%8A%92%E5%9B%A7%E8%AE%B0/read
  invalid byte sequence

DONE upgrade password_hash to bcrypt

DONE password_reset_request, password_reset_request_post, password_reset, password_reset_post - force_ssl 

DONE change_email process.  Need to take into account users that never verified their original email.
DONE on register_verify_notice, let user know that if their email address is not valid, they can change their address.

DONE.  didn't work out  - download IE8 test vm.  doesn't have ZH version and requires sp3 update CD to install it.
  https://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads
DONE notify user of password_reset_request option on failed login

DONE send_registered_email_verify needs to be gone.  not gonna send a second email.  they have to send one to us.

DONE BUG If I go to http://mihudie.com, read page 1, then go to page 2, register shows, then I click login and login and get redirected to page 2...but I have already verified my email and I'm getting the :notice div tell me to verify.  Maybe its best to not have a success_message and just do a check if the user has not verified and always display a message until they do.

DONE register verify code is wrong.  Shouldn't be using public_id for the code.  public_id is good for referals, but not things like use once codes.

DONE send_registered_email_verify has a error meessage that shows premium_to date.  This is not correct if user has premium_at but not premium_to set.
  and in view account#index.html.haml @:
       - if current_user.premium_at
  and registered_email_verify at bottom

DONE page_title on book#read - if its page 1, even if not specified, do not prefix chapter name.

DONE _book.haml.html.  author span is only showing on mobile.  no way to show author on desktop or tablet.

DONE  books_offline_history collection, fix model in 2.0. old data not needed.  mongo collection books_offline_history is storing the book_id attribute as a String.  This is inconsistent with how Bookmarks store book_id as ObjectId.  Since there are only 8 of these docs, we can hand migrate to an ObjectId pre-launch.

DONE commpare list.haml.html & index.haml.html & tag.haml.html.  refactor?  can I make a column or flow list of books and authors?

DONE if User has a bad cookie, remove the cookie.  Test case:  I'm an admin user and login as myself.  I go to the admin page to remove myself.  After removing, I get redirected to the home page.  My cookie should get deleted when the home page renders as it contains an invalid user id.
