bookmark menu rendering inefficient

set User.email_bounces, default 0

page_title on book#read - if its page 1, even if not specified, do not prefix chapter name.

page_titles for book indexes/sorts need work.

send_registered_email_verify has a error meessage that shows premium_to date.  This is not correct if user has premium_at but not premium_to set.

book#read needs to know that there could be more than one book with the same title/author pair.  If there is, there should be only on that does not have duplicate attribute.  BUT if that is not the case, should use the book with latest updated_at time.

register verify code is wrong.  Shouldn't be using public_id for the code.  public_id is good for referals, but not things like use once codes.

password_reset_request, password_reset_request_post, password_reset, password_reset_post - force_ssl 

notify user of password_reset_request option on failed login

change_email process.  Need to take into account users that never verified their original email.
on register_verify_notice, let user know that if their email address is not valid, they can change their address.

set Mandrill webhook for bounced email.  Capture bounce info in user and log UserEvent. Don't send more emails to that address until they use a verified address.  Display account notice if email_bounced_at is set.

rails logrotate not working

see about mongodb logrotate

_mhd_session cookie shows in firefox for both dev.mihudie.com and mihudie.com at the same time.  

Andrea - test on iPad and Android phones.  Test on popular Chinese browsers.

test on Android phones.

see about using zepto.js or other instead of jquery.  maybe do a browser check and use jquery 1.11.1 for under IE10 and jquery 2 or jquery mobile for over?


new model
---------- 
  User gets 1 month premium_to on registration.  After they validate their email.
change premium attribute to premium_at. 
  Two week after, send user email asking if they've enjoyed mihudie.  If they would like to invite a friend, they can use the link in this email and both they and their friend gets another month free.  Try if Mandrill can send the two-week-later email when the validate-success mail is sent. 

  For existing users, create a new email to notice them of their free month (when I get around to writing a script to roll through existing users).  These users must verify their email too!  We can fix this by having a seperate landing page for this email to claim their referral URL.  Set their new premium_to and send them an email as well two weeks later to let them invite a friend.

  A user may buy a full year premium (added to their existing time) for 60 rmb or $10 USD.

DONE remove SSLv3.  requires reconfiginzing old browsers and serving a page from nginx that recommends the use to install Firefox.

DONE see about adding spdy to nginx ssl

DONE reissue namecheap SSL cert.  update nginx conf: remove SSLv3

DONE _book.haml.html.  author span is only showing on mobile.  no way to show author on desktop or tablet.

DONE  books_offline_history collection, fix model in 2.0. old data not needed.  mongo collection books_offline_history is storing the book_id attribute as a String.  This is inconsistent with how Bookmarks store book_id as ObjectId.  Since there are only 8 of these docs, we can hand migrate to an ObjectId pre-launch.

DONE commpare list.haml.html & index.haml.html & tag.haml.html.  refactor?  can I make a column or flow list of books and authors?

DONE for next/prev page on lists, try using javascript technique used for book theme and top buttons.

DONE - PAY DREAMHOST

DONE reading layout.  The only diff is
     = render 'layouts/reading_menu'
     refactor? or use rails content_for?

DONE better flash notices.  better form errors. 

DONE setup logrotation for rails. rotate daily.  keep 30 days.

DONE install goaccess.  basic tests.

DONE use suckerpunch instead of sidekiq
DONE record suckerpunch email sends so I can verify the integrity of the backround processes.

DONE if User has a bad cookie, remove the cookie.  Test case:  I'm an admin user and login as myself.  I go to the admin page to remove myself.  After removing, I get redirected to the home page.  My cookie should get deleted when the home page renders as it contains an invalid user id.

DONE see nginx error.log.  when passenger starts, ssh-keychain causes an error.

DONE - Its set to Weekly, not daily. ;) find out why nginx log don't seem to rotate
