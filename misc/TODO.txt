email TODOs...see below

reading mode max line length is too much.

home page h2 looks good "welcome to Mihudie 2.0".  An h1 is too big.  We shoul make h1 look like h2.

NOTE - see https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login  I like their input fields
also fields from bitbucket.org login page

backtracks - can a controller be asked for its tracks_parent or its tracks_all. use fore tracks menu content.  Include referral URL as top item in tracks_all if its a mihudue.com page.

* script to rewrite book summary's as replacing <br> with wrapping <p>
* if this works ok.  See about doing it for book reading files...big task.

ONE - finish all user & password behavior
    account page.  logout link, recent bookmarks, manage bookmarks link, change_password link, change email link, set theme link
    send_email_verification_path - make this a get so there is no form needed.
      log event for email_sent
      log event when verified
    show backyard access date
    show referral link if not used
    bookmarks page - page through and remove bookmarks
       BooksController#read needs to set bookmark
    change_password page
    password_reset_request page
    password_reset page
    change_email page
    set theme page
    force_ssl on account/password_change, password_reset_reuqest and password_reset
    DONE test mods to user login, LoginLog, logout kills cookie, register stores ip, etc
    logout link in menu bar if not mobile.  only on account page for mobile

need an Action Link.  This is an anchor styled so the user knows its an action.  Bigger and bold but not a button.  Need this for account page links like password_change, manage bookmarks, etc.

add shortcuts to account behavior on account nav list

add bookmarks to bookmarks nav list

decide how to handle breadcrumbs and its menu.

if book is offline, gracefully return user to home or prior page with error message.

better flash notices.  better form errors. 

set theme behavior.  js needs to set cookie mhd_theme value to be the theme class.  server can ignore this cookie.

account/theme pages needs an action link to toggle "show/don't show theme tools in reading mode.  This setting can be stored in the same mhd_theme cookie.

on login failure, be sure to show user password-reset link
