ONE - sitemap.xml script
  Should sitemap include old book links with objectId?

ONE - add PayPal Express

HALF - Write script to fix this:
mongo collection books_offline_history is storing the book_id attribute as a String.  This is inconsistent with how Bookmarks store book_id as ObjectId.  Since there are only 8 of these docs, we can hand migrate to an ObjectId pre-launch.

HALF - script to ensure all books have tag_names_pp and all books have li data

user referal tracking.

better flash notices.  better form errors. 

set theme behavior

ONE - review email template.  It may not be repsonsive for email readers.

lazy save pre-rendered book li and genre_tags_pp if doesn't exist

awstats config to exclude scoutapp and uptimerobot and 127.0.0.1
generated reports accessible by secret URL..through Rails or HTTP auth?

HALF - setup exception_notificaion and test. 
  see if we can write exceptions to file and have scout pick them up.  

HALF - setup rails logrotate.  ensure it works right with scout processing
