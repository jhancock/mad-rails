*****************************************

ONE - setup awstats...install, setup processing prior to nginx logrotate, auto-create reports.  see if old us1 and lin1 data can be brought in.  maybe its easier to segment the old data and keep them as archives.
awstats config to exclude scoutapp and uptimerobot and 127.0.0.1

HALF - setup exception_notificaion and test. 
  see if we can write exceptions to file and have scout pick them up.  

HALF - setup rails logrotate.  ensure it works right with scout processing

HALF - setup UFW - uncomplicated firewall

ONE - review email template.  It may not be repsonsive for email readers.

HALF - fix nginx conf so there is a default server that returns nothing.  This will keep people from hitting it with the ip address.

HALF - Write script to fix this:
mongo collection books_offline_history is storing the book_id attribute as a String.  This is inconsistent with how Bookmarks store book_id as ObjectId.  Since there are only 8 of these docs, we can hand migrate to an ObjectId pre-launch.

HALF - script to ensure all books have tag_names_pp

TWO - admin pages

ONE - add PayPal Express

THREE - add Alipay

ONE - send to kindle behavior
     set limits per month for backyard books.  all purchased books can send.

Scout Mongodb plugin reporting size of storage around 400mb, but the files in /var/lib/mongodb are over 1G.  Send support email.

Scout Rails plugin is properly triggering alert when over 500 request/minute.  But when I go to the web console, the history shows almost nothing.  I don't see the spike.

ONE - setup mina for more reliable deploys
learn how to store version of gems for relase.  bundle vendor?

HALF - setup tarsnap on vr1

HALF - sitemap.xml script

TWO - new model: user gets 2 weeks to the backyard free on registration.  after register tell user they must verify their email to get their referral code.  use referral link to get a friend to register.  friend gets 2 weeks free and referee get another month free.  User can buy one year access to mihudie backyard for $9.95...no recurring fees.
