  When books available, money gets added to their account in minimum 30rmb for alipay and $10 USD for PayPal.  Books typical cost 3 to 5 points per 1000 characters (no white space).  A book is charged per chapter with points calculated by the per 1000 character rate.
  1 RMB = 100 points.  $10 USD = 6000 points.  As a user spends points/coins, for each 1000, they get a free premium month added.  Do some calcs to ensure the coin to pay-in-anvace numbers are balanced.  Notify a user when they get a free month ;).
